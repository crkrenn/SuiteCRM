Installing PHP Composer on an Ubuntu system involves downloading the Composer binary and setting it up so you can run it globally. Follow these steps to install Composer on your Ubuntu machine:

### Step 1: Update Your Package List
Ensure your package list is up-to-date:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install php-cli unzip curl
```

### Step 3: Download Composer Installer
Download the Composer installer script:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o composer-setup.php
```

### Step 4: Verify the Installer
Verify the installerâ€™s SHA-384 hash to ensure the downloaded script is safe to use. Replace `HASH` with the actual hash obtained from the Composer website:
```bash
HASH=`curl -sS https://composer.github.io/installer.sig`
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '$HASH') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
```

### Step 5: Install Composer Globally
Run the installer script to install Composer globally:
```bash
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

### Step 6: Clean Up
Remove the installer script:
```bash
rm composer-setup.php
```

### Step 7: Verify Installation
Verify that Composer was installed correctly by checking its version:
```bash
composer --version
```

### Summary
By following these steps, you will have installed Composer globally on your Ubuntu system. This setup allows you to manage PHP project dependencies efficiently. 

For more details, you can refer to the [official Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) and the [Composer installation guide](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
